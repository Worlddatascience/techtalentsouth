### Master Big Data In Little Time / History
 
[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/bigdata/history/index.ipynb)

The term ‘Big Data’ has been in use since the early 1990s. Although it is not exactly known who first used the term, most people credit John R. Mashey (who at the time worked at Silicon Graphics) for making the term popular.

In its true essence, Big Data is not something that is completely new or only of the last two decades. Over the course of centuries, people have been trying to use data analysis and analytics techniques to support their decision-making process. The ancient Egyptians around 300 BC already tried to capture all existing ‘data’ in the library of Alexandria. Moreover, the Roman Empire used to carefully analyze statistics of their military to determine the optimal distribution for their armies.

However, in the last two decades, the volume and speed with which data is generated has changed – beyond measures of human comprehension. The total amount of data in the world was 4.4 zettabytes in 2013. That is set to rise steeply to 44 zettabytes by 2020. To put that in perspective, 44 zettabytes is equivalent to 44 trillion gigabytes. Even with the most advanced technologies today, it is impossible to analyze all this data. The need to process these increasingly larger (and unstructured) data sets is how traditional data analysis transformed into ‘Big Data’ in the last decade.

### Master Big Data In Little Time / Data: SQL

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/bigdata/data/sql/index.ipynb)

Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

### Master Big Data In Little Time / Data: Hadoop

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/bigdata/data/hadoop/index.ipynb)

Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. Originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware—still the common use—it has also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework.

### Master Big Data In Little Time / Data: NoSQL

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/bigdata/data/nosql/index.ipynb)

A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures.

### Master Big Data In Little Time / Data: Spark

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/bigdata/data/spark/index.ipynb)

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

## Software

Anaconda is a free and open-source[6] distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

- Anaconda (packages included) - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- Miniconda (only Conda and Python packages included) - https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

### Installation

To install the requirements using [conda](http://conda.pydata.org), run the following at the command-line:

```
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

To create a stand-alone environment named ``PDSH`` with Python 3.5 and all the required package versions, run the following:

```
$ conda create -n PDSH python=3.5 --file requirements.txt
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.

## Package Application Managers

You can install the executables of Anaconda, Conda, Python or you can use a Package Application Manager that is applicable to your operating system. This allows you to maintain, update, install and configure all the necessary software components via automated scripting.

- [Brew (OS X, Linux)](https://brew.sh/)
- [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://chocolatey.org/)

## What is BREW?

For Mac OS, Linux

Home-brew installs the stuff you need that Apple or your Linux system didn’t.  
[See list of all packages](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)


	⁃	BREW package definition files are called “formulae”
	⁃	BREW “cask”, just like a formula, is for GUI installs.
	⁃	BREW “cellar” is where everything is installed /usr/local/Cellar


The simplest way to create a formula for your own software is to create a GitHub repository called homebrew-<something>; put your formula file in it; then type brew tap <username>/<something> to add this new source of formulae to your Homebrew installation and so get access to all its formulae.

Companies have internal Homebrew taps for their own utilities. There are a lot of public taps like homebrew/science for scientific software, atlassian/tap for Atlassian software, and ska-sa/tap for radio astronomy.

**[Brew Formulae / Casks](https://formulae.brew.sh/)**

## What is CHOCOLATEY?

For Windows

Chocolatey has the largest online registry of Windows packages. Chocolatey packages encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping installers, executables, zips, and/or scripts into a compiled package file.

[Search all Chocolatey Packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages)
